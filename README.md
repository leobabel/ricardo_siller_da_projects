Data Analysis projects developed by Ricardo Siller

Here you'll find:

1.- Music Stream Project: in which I applied data processing and statistical methods for analyzing data from a music stream service in twin cities.

2.- Instacart Project: in which I analyzed commercial information for a food delivery app.

3.- Megaline Project: in which I analyzed fees from a cellphone company.

4.- Zuber Project: in which I analyze passenger preferences and discern the influence of external factors on rides. I scrutinize competitor data, and put hypotheses to the test, particularly exploring the correlation between weather conditions and ride frequency.

More projects coming soon.
